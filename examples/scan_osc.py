"""
Example: Radio scanning with OSC event forwarding.

This script runs Substation with an OscEventSender attached, so channel
state changes and saved recordings are emitted as OSC messages to a
downstream tool — typically the Subsequence MIDI sequencer listening on
UDP port 9000.  When sampler_host is also set, finalised recordings
additionally trigger a /sample/import message at the Subsample sampler
(UDP port 9002) so it can load the new WAV file directly without
watching the output directory.

Key concepts:
1. Loading the configuration and constructing a RadioScanner.
2. Constructing an OscEventSender and attaching it to the scanner.
3. Adding additional custom callbacks alongside the OSC forwarder.
4. Running the asynchronous scan loop.

Requires the optional OSC extra:  pip install -e ".[osc]"
