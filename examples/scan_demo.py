"""
Example: Using Substation as a Python Module

This script demonstrates how to integrate the Substation directly into your
own Python projects. This is useful if you want to build custom automation,
dashboards, or integration with other systems (like Home Assistant or MQTT).

Key concepts:
1. Loading the configuration.
2. Initializing the RadioScanner object.
3. Adding state change callbacks (events).
4. Running the asynchronous scan loop.
