# Substation

## Overview
Substation is a high-performance tool for monitoring and recording radio activity using Software Defined Radio (SDR) hardware. It is designed to be used in two ways:

1.  **As a Command-Line Tool**: Quickly scan and record bands using simple terminal commands.
2.  **As a Python Module**: Integrate radio scanning, detection, and callbacks directly into your own Python applications.

By connecting a supported USB receiver (like an RTL-SDR or HackRF), you can scan wide ranges of the radio spectrum - such as Airband or Maritime frequencies - and automatically record transmissions as they occur. The software handles the technical signal processing and hardware management in the background, allowing for efficient 24/7 monitoring even on modest hardware like a Raspberry Pi.

## Hardware Requirements
To use this software, a compatible Software Defined Radio (SDR) USB device is required. The code has been specifically tested and verified with the following hardware:

*   **[RTL-SDR Blog V4 and V3](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/)**: High-quality, low-cost receivers. 24 MHz - 1.7 GHz, up to 2.4 MHz sample rate.
*   **[HackRF One](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/one/)**: A wideband transceiver capable of monitoring much larger frequency spans. 1 MHz - 6 GHz, 2-20 MHz sample rate.
*   **[AirSpy R2](https://airspy.com/airspy-r2/)**: High-dynamic-range receiver with 12-bit ADC. 24 MHz - 1.8 GHz, 2.5/10 MHz sample rate. Requires SoapySDR (see below).
*   **[AirSpy HF+ Discovery](https://airspy.com/airspy-hf-discovery/)**: Precision HF/VHF receiver. 0.5 kHz - 31 MHz + 60-260 MHz, up to 768 kHz bandwidth. Requires SoapySDR (see below).
*   Any other device supported by **[SoapySDR](https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR)** via the `soapy:<driver>` device type.

## Key Features & Optimizations
- **Advanced Signal Detection**: Uses Welch's Power Spectral Density (PSD) estimation for stable, low-variance activity detection. The noise floor is EMA-smoothed across slices to eliminate jitter, with a warmup period that absorbs SDR hardware startup transients before detection begins.
- **Parallel Multi-Channel Recording**: Simultaneously detects and records all active channels in a band - unlike traditional handheld scanners which only play one channel at a time.
- **High-Fidelity Demodulation**: Implements stateful AM and NFM demodulation with continuous phase tracking and DC-blocking, eliminating pops and discontinuities between audio blocks.
- **Precise Transition Trimming**: After coarse PSD-based detection, demodulated audio is scanned at sample level to find exact signal boundaries. Padding is added around the boundary and faded with a half-cosine S-curve, preserving signal content (including attack transients) while eliminating clicks.
- **Hardware Efficiency**:
    - **Vectorized Math**: Heavy processing is delegated to NumPy and SciPy for maximum throughput.
    - **Zero-Copy Architecture**: Uses memory stride tricks for overlapping FFT segments, avoiding expensive data copying.
    - **Lazy Evaluation**: Computationally expensive segment analysis is performed only when transitions are detected, drastically reducing idle CPU load.
    - **Pre-Allocated Ring Buffer**: Per-channel audio buffering uses a fixed NumPy array with modulo wrap-around, eliminating per-flush concatenation and GC pressure.
- **State-of-the-Art Processing**:
    - **Vectorized AGC**: High-quality, smooth automatic gain control for AM with independent attack and release timings.
    - **Noise-Floor-Guided Spectral Subtraction**: The band-wide PSD noise floor is passed to the spectral subtraction stage for more reliable noise frame classification, reducing musical noise artifacts compared to percentile-only heuristics.
    - **Float64 Filter State**: IIR filter states (channel extraction, decimation) use double precision to prevent rounding drift in long-running sessions.
- **Parallel Scanning**: Supports multiple SDR devices (RTL-SDR and HackRF) simultaneously with asynchronous I/O.
- **Archive Ready**: Automatic recording to Broadcast WAV (BWF) with embedded metadata (frequency, timestamps, modulation).

## Quick Start
1) Install dependencies (see `installation.txt` for SDR drivers).
2) Configure bands in `config.yaml`.
3) Install package in editable mode:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
4) Run:

```bash
substation --band air_civil_bristol --device-type rtlsdr --device-index 0
```

Audio files are written to:
```
./audio/YYYY-MM-DD/<band>/<timestamp>_<band>_<channel>_<snr>dB_<device>_<index>.wav
```

## Command Line
```bash
substation --band <band> [--config <path>] [--device-type rtlsdr|hackrf|airspy|airspyhf|soapy:<driver>] [--device-index N]
substation --list-bands
```

## Python Module Usage
You can also use the scanner as a library in your own code. This allows you to respond to radio events programmatically.

```python
import asyncio

import substation.config
import substation.scanner

# State Callback: Triggered whenever a signal starts or stops
def my_state_handler (band: str, ch: int, active: bool, snr: float) -> None:
	print (f"Channel {ch} is now {'ON' if active else 'OFF'} ({snr:.1f} dB)")

# Recording Callback: Triggered when a file is finalized and closed
def my_recording_handler (band: str, ch: int, file_path: str) -> None:
	print (f"Recording finished: {file_path}")

async def main () -> None:

	"""
	Initialize the scanner and respond to real-time events.
	"""

	# Load configuration
	config_data = substation.config.load_config ("config.yaml")

	# Initialize scanner instance
	scanner = substation.scanner.RadioScanner (
		config=config_data,
		band_name="pmr",
		device_type="rtlsdr"
	)

	# Register the handlers
	scanner.add_state_callback (my_state_handler)
	scanner.add_recording_callback (my_recording_handler)

	# Start the asynchronous scan loop
	await scanner.scan ()

if __name__ == "__main__":
	asyncio.run (main ())
```

See [examples/scan_demo.py](examples/scan_demo.py) for a more detailed implementation.

Options:
- `--config`, `-c`: path to config file (default `config.yaml`).
- `--band`, `-b`: band name to scan (required unless `--list-bands`).
- `--device-type`, `-t`: `rtlsdr`, `hackrf`, `airspy`, `airspyhf`, or `soapy:<driver>` (default `rtlsdr`).
- `--device-index`, `-i`: device index (default `0`).
- `--list-bands`: list available bands and exit.

## Configuration
Config file is YAML. The top-level keys are `scanner`, `recording`, `band_defaults`, and `bands`.

Scanner
```
scanner:
  sdr_device_sample_size: 131072
  band_time_slice_ms: 200
  sample_queue_maxsize: 30
  calibration_frequency_hz: 93.7e+6
  stuck_channel_threshold_seconds: 60
```
- `sdr_device_sample_size`: number of IQ samples per SDR callback. Higher values reduce callback overhead but increase latency.
- `band_time_slice_ms`: time slice used for PSD/SNR detection. Must be a multiple of `sdr_device_sample_size` (rounded up internally).
- `sample_queue_maxsize`: async queue depth. 10-50 is typical; higher tolerates bursts but uses more RAM.
- `calibration_frequency_hz`: optional known signal for PPM correction; set to `null` to disable.
- `stuck_channel_threshold_seconds`: optional duration in seconds after which a constant signal will trigger a "Stuck Channel" warning. Useful for identifying interference or stuck transmitters. Set to `null` to disable.

Recording
```
recording:
  buffer_size_seconds: 30
  disk_flush_interval_seconds: 5
  audio_sample_rate: 16000
  audio_output_dir: "./audio"
  fade_in_ms: 3
  fade_out_ms: 5
  soft_limit_drive: 2.0
```
- `buffer_size_seconds`: max in-memory audio per channel before drops.
- `disk_flush_interval_seconds`: how often to flush to disk.
- `audio_sample_rate`: output WAV rate (Hz).
- `fade_in_ms`/`fade_out_ms`: half-cosine fades applied to the padding region at channel start/stop (signal content is never attenuated).
- `soft_limit_drive`: post-processing soft limiter drive. Typical range 1.5-3.0 (higher = stronger limiting).
- `noise_reduction_enabled`: toggle spectral subtraction noise reduction (default: true).
- `recording_hold_time_ms`: duration in ms to continue recording after signal drops below threshold (default: 500).

Band Defaults
```
band_defaults:
  AIR:
    channel_spacing: 8.333e+3
    modulation: AM
    snr_threshold_db: 4.5
    sdr_gain_db: 30
```
These settings are merged into each band of the same `type`.

Bands
```
bands:
  air_civil_bristol:
    type: AIR
    freq_start: 125.5e+6
    freq_end: 126.0e+6
    sample_rate: 1.0e+6
    exclude_channel_indices: [33, 34]
```
Per-band keys:
- `freq_start` / `freq_end`: Hz.
- `channel_spacing`: Hz.
- `sample_rate`: Hz. Must cover the band plus margins; higher rates increase CPU.
- `channel_width`: optional; defaults to `channel_spacing * 0.84`.
- `type`: used to inherit defaults from `band_defaults`.
- `modulation`: `AM` or `NFM`.
- `recording_enabled`: enable recording for this band. Optional, defaults to `false` (can also be set in `band_defaults`).
- `snr_threshold_db`: detection threshold (dB above noise floor).
- `sdr_gain_db`: numeric or `auto`.
- `sdr_gain_elements`: optional dict mapping gain element names to dB values for per-stage control (e.g., `{LNA: 10, MIX: 5, VGA: 12}`). Available elements are logged at startup. Takes priority over `sdr_gain_db`.
- `sdr_device_settings`: optional dict of device-specific settings passed via SoapySDR (e.g., `{biastee: "true"}`). Available settings are logged at DEBUG level on startup.
- `exclude_channel_indices`: 0-based indices to skip (no analysis, no recording).

## SoapySDR Installation (AirSpy and other devices)

AirSpy devices (and any other `soapy:<driver>` device) require SoapySDR, which is installed at the system level:

```bash
# Raspberry Pi OS / Debian
sudo apt install -y soapysdr-tools python3-soapysdr
sudo apt install -y soapysdr-module-airspy      # AirSpy R2
sudo apt install -y soapysdr-module-airspyhf    # AirSpy HF+ Discovery

# If soapysdr-module-airspyhf is not in your distro's repos (e.g., Raspberry Pi OS),
# build from source instead:
sudo apt install -y libairspyhf-dev libsoapysdr-dev cmake
git clone https://github.com/pothosware/SoapyAirspyHF.git
cd SoapyAirspyHF && mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make && sudo make install && cd ../..

# Verify SoapySDR can see connected devices
SoapySDRUtil --find
```

The Python virtual environment **must** be created with `--system-site-packages` to access the system-installed SoapySDR bindings:

```bash
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages /home/si/venvs/substation
```

## Broadcast WAV (BWF) & Metadata
Each recording captures industry-standard **Broadcast WAV (BWF)** metadata (EBU Tech 3285). This embeds technical details directly into the audio file, making it ideal for archival and automated post-processing.

**Compatibility**: These are standard `.wav` files. They will play perfectly in any normal audio player (VLC, Windows Media Player, Audacity, mobile devices, etc.).

### Metadata Example
If you open a recording in a professional audio tool or a BWF viewer, you will see fields like these:

| Field | Example Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Description** | `{"band":"pmr","channel_index":0,"channel_freq":446006250.0}` | Machine-readable JSON with channel details |
| **Coding History** | `A=PCM,F=16000,W=16,M=mono,T=NFM;Frequency=446.00625MHz` | Technical signal chain (Algorithm, Rate, Modulation) |
| **Originator** | `Substation` | The software that created the file |
| **Origination Date** | `2026-01-27` | Date the recording started |
| **Time Reference** | `1152000` | Sample count since midnight (for precise timing) |


## AirSpy Examples

Scan PMR446 with an AirSpy R2 (higher dynamic range than RTL-SDR, with per-element gain control):

```bash
substation --band pmr --device-type airspy --device-index 0
```

To fine-tune the AirSpy R2's gain stages for best noise figure, set per-element gains in `config.yaml` instead of a single `sdr_gain_db` value. Available element names and their ranges are logged at INFO level on startup — use those to guide your values:

```yaml
bands:
  pmr:
    type: PMR
    freq_start: 446.00625e+6
    freq_end: 446.19375e+6
    sample_rate: 2.5e6
    sdr_gain_elements:
      LNA: 10     # Adjust based on ranges shown in startup log
      MIX: 5
      VGA: 12
```

Scan HF shortwave bands with an AirSpy HF+ Discovery:

```bash
substation --band amateur_hf_20m --device-type airspyhf --device-index 0
```

The HF+ Discovery has a maximum bandwidth of 768 kHz, so `sample_rate` must be set accordingly:

```yaml
bands:
  amateur_hf_20m:
    freq_start: 14.0e+6
    freq_end: 14.35e+6
    channel_spacing: 3.0e+3
    sample_rate: 768.0e+3
    modulation: AM
    recording_enabled: true
    snr_threshold_db: 6.0
    sdr_gain_db: auto
```

## Gain Tuning

SDR gain controls how much the received signal is amplified before digitisation. Too little gain and weak signals are lost in the noise floor; too much and strong signals overdrive the ADC, causing distortion and spurious detections.

**Simple approach (recommended starting point)**: set `sdr_gain_db` to a numeric value or `auto`. When set to a single number, SoapySDR distributes the gain across the device's internal stages automatically — this produces good results for most setups without any per-element knowledge. Start here and only move to per-element tuning if you want to squeeze out the last bit of performance.

**Per-element tuning (advanced)**: devices with multiple gain stages (like the AirSpy R2) allow individual control via `sdr_gain_elements`. This can improve reception quality because the *order* of gain stages matters for noise performance:

| Stage | Role | Tuning guidance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LNA** (Low-Noise Amplifier) | First amplifier in the chain. Has the greatest impact on overall noise figure. | Set as high as possible without overloading from strong nearby signals. This is where sensitivity is won or lost. |
| **Mixer** | Frequency conversion stage. | Moderate gain. Too high increases intermodulation distortion (ghost signals from mixing products of strong stations). |
| **VGA** (Variable Gain Amplifier) | Final gain stage before the ADC. | Use to bring the overall signal level into the ADC's optimal range. Boosting here amplifies noise from earlier stages equally, so it contributes the least to sensitivity. |

The general principle is: **maximise gain early in the chain** (LNA) and **minimise gain late** (VGA), within the limits of what doesn't cause overload. This keeps the signal-to-noise ratio as high as possible through the receive chain.

**Practical tips**:
- Available element names and their valid ranges are logged at INFO level on startup. Check these before setting values.
- Start with `sdr_gain_db: auto` or a moderate overall value. Observe the noise floor and SNR values in the logs.
- If you see false detections or distortion, reduce LNA gain first.
- If weak signals are missed, increase LNA gain (and reduce VGA if the ADC is clipping).
- Optimal values depend on your antenna, band, and local RF environment — a rooftop antenna in a city needs different gain from a small whip in a rural area.
- Airband (AM, 118-137 MHz) typically needs less gain than PMR (NFM, 446 MHz) because aircraft transmitters are more powerful (5-25W) than PMR handhelds (0.5W).

## Parallel Scans (Multiple Devices)
Run one process per device:

```bash
substation --band air_civil_bristol --device-type rtlsdr --device-index 0
substation --band pmr --device-type rtlsdr --device-index 1
```

If you need stricter real-time behavior, you can pin each scan to a CPU core:

```bash
taskset -c 2 substation --band air_civil_bristol --device-index 0
taskset -c 3 substation --band pmr --device-index 1
```

## Resource and Performance Notes
- **Sample rate dominates CPU**. Large bands at high sample rates increase FFT/PSD load.
- **Overrun warnings** indicate the processing of a slice exceeded its real-time window. This can lead to dropped IQ blocks (`Sample queue full`).
- **Noise reduction** runs during write/flush if enabled (default). It uses `apply_spectral_subtraction` which is efficient and receives the band-wide noise floor for improved frame classification. The alternative `apply_noisereduce` implementation exists in `substation/dsp/noise_reduction.py` for reference but is not used by default as it is significantly more CPU-intensive.
- **Queue size** provides burst tolerance but uses RAM (each slice can be several MB).

If you see repeated `Sample queue full` warnings, reduce the band's `sample_rate`, exclude channels, or increase `sample_queue_maxsize`.

## Limitations
- Processing is slice-based; extremely wide bands or multiple high-rate scans can exceed real-time capacity on low-power CPUs.
- If you enable `apply_noisereduce` (requires code change), it is CPU-intensive for long chunks; on constrained devices, stick with the default `apply_spectral_subtraction` or reduce `disk_flush_interval_seconds`.
