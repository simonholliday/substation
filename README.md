# Substation

## Overview
Substation is a high-performance tool for monitoring and recording radio activity using Software Defined Radio (SDR) hardware. It is designed to be used in two ways:

1.  **As a Command-Line Tool**: Quickly scan and record bands using simple terminal commands.
2.  **As a Python Module**: Integrate radio scanning, detection, and callbacks directly into your own Python applications.

By connecting a supported USB receiver (like an RTL-SDR or HackRF), you can scan wide ranges of the radio spectrum - such as Airband or Maritime frequencies - and automatically record transmissions as they occur. The software handles the technical signal processing and hardware management in the background, allowing for efficient 24/7 monitoring even on modest hardware like a Raspberry Pi.

## Supported Devices

To use this software, a compatible Software Defined Radio (SDR) USB device is required. Each supported device below has a self-contained card with its specifications, recommended starting configuration, common gotchas, and a copy-pasteable example band so you can get a working scan in a few minutes. Different SDR devices have very different capabilities — settings that work well on one device may need adjusting on another, and the cards capture the differences that actually matter in practice.

Any other device with a SoapySDR driver module installed can be used too — see [Other SoapySDR Devices](#other-soapysdr-devices) below.

### RTL-SDR Blog V4 / V3

A high-quality, low-cost general-purpose receiver. The natural starting point for new users — well-supported, easy to drive, and good enough for most VHF/UHF scanning. Limited dynamic range from its 8-bit ADC.

| Spec               | Value                                                  |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| Frequency range    | 24 MHz - 1.766 GHz (with gaps)                         |
| Max bandwidth      | 2.4 MHz                                                |
| Sample rates       | Continuous, up to 2.4 MHz (typical: 2.048 MHz)         |
| ADC resolution     | 8-bit                                                  |
| Gain architecture  | Single stage                                           |
| AGC                | Hardware AGC                                           |
| Driver             | `pyrtlsdr` (>=0.3.0,<0.4.0) — Python binding           |
| `--device-type`    | `rtl`, `rtlsdr`, `rtl-sdr`                             |
| Best for           | General VHF/UHF scanning, low cost, easy setup         |

**Setup** — see [installation.txt §1](installation.txt) for the librtlsdr fork build and the DVB-T driver blacklist step.

**Recommended starting config**
- `snr_threshold_db: 4.5`
- `sdr_gain_db: auto` (engages hardware AGC, which is well-tuned for most bands)
- `activation_variance_db: 3.0` (default — leave alone unless you see false triggers)
- `sample_rate: 2.048e6` for most bands

**Gotchas**
- The Blog V4 needs the [rtl-sdr-blog fork](https://github.com/rtlsdrblog/rtl-sdr-blog) of librtlsdr. The standard distro `librtlsdr` is missing the `rtlsdr_set_dithering` symbol that newer pyrtlsdr versions need; this is why the project pins `pyrtlsdr<0.4.0`.
- The default Linux DVB-T driver claims the device on insertion as a TV tuner — it must be blacklisted (installation.txt covers this).
- The 8-bit ADC limits dynamic range. A strong adjacent station can desensitise weak ones in the same capture.
- Manual gain values are typically 20-40 dB if you don't want AGC.

**Working example band**

```yaml
air_civil_bristol:
    type: AIR
    freq_start: 125.5e+6
    freq_end: 126.0e+6
    sample_rate: 1.024e6
```

### HackRF One

A wideband transceiver covering 1 MHz to 6 GHz with up to 20 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth — by far the widest single-tune capture of any device here. The trade-off is no hardware AGC and the same 8-bit ADC dynamic-range limit as the RTL-SDR.

| Spec               | Value                                                              |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frequency range    | 1 MHz - 6 GHz                                                      |
| Max bandwidth      | 20 MHz (16 MHz is the practical reliable maximum)                  |
| Sample rates       | Continuous, 2 - 20 MHz                                             |
| ADC resolution     | 8-bit                                                              |
| Gain architecture  | LNA (0-40 dB, 8 dB steps) + VGA (0-62 dB, 2 dB steps)              |
| AGC                | None — `auto` falls back to a sensible default and warns           |
| Driver             | `python_hackrf` (with fallback to `hackrf` / `pyhackrf`)           |
| `--device-type`    | `hackrf`, `hackrf-one`, `hackrfone`                                |
| Best for           | Wideband monitoring, multi-band capture in a single tune           |

**Setup** — see [installation.txt §2](installation.txt) for the USB buffer tuning (`usbcore.usbfs_memory_mb=1000`) and [installation.txt §3](installation.txt) for the `libhackrf-dev` system package.

**Recommended starting config**
- `snr_threshold_db: 6`
- `sdr_gain_db: 36` (or `auto` to accept the LNA=32 / VGA=30 default)
- `activation_variance_db: 3.0`
- `sample_rate: 16e6` for the widest single capture; lower (2-4 MHz) for narrow bands

**Gotchas**
- **No hardware AGC.** Setting `sdr_gain_db: auto` does not enable AGC — there isn't one. The wrapper logs a warning and sets sensible defaults (LNA=32, VGA=30) so the device still works.
- A numeric `sdr_gain_db` is silently clamped and stepped to the LNA's 8 dB grid and the VGA's 2 dB grid. Asking for 35 dB gets you 32. Check the startup log if the actual values matter.
- High sample rates (~16-20 MHz) require raising the kernel USB buffer limit; otherwise samples will be dropped. See [installation.txt §2](installation.txt).
- The 8-bit ADC has the same dynamic-range caveats as the RTL-SDR — wide captures including a strong station can desensitise weak ones.
- Multiple Python bindings exist (`python_hackrf`, `hackrf`, `pyhackrf`) with different APIs; the wrapper auto-detects whichever is installed.

**Working example band**

```yaml
dmr:
    type: DMR
    freq_start: 452.5e+6
    freq_end: 460.5e+6
    sample_rate: 12.5e+6
```

### AirSpy R2

A high-dynamic-range VHF/UHF receiver with a 12-bit ADC (≈16-bit effective from oversampling) and three independently tuneable gain stages. Considerably more sensitive than the RTL-SDR for the same money tier, with enough bandwidth (10 MHz) to cover practical surveillance bands in a single tune.

| Spec               | Value                                                                         |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frequency range    | 24 MHz - 1.8 GHz                                                              |
| Max bandwidth      | 10 MHz                                                                        |
| Sample rates       | Discrete: 2.5 MHz or 10 MHz                                                   |
| ADC resolution     | 12-bit (≈16-bit effective from oversampling)                                  |
| Gain architecture  | LNA + Mixer + VGA (per-element control via `sdr_gain_elements`)               |
| AGC                | Hardware AGC via SoapySDR                                                     |
| Driver             | SoapySDR + `soapysdr-module-airspy` (system package)                          |
| `--device-type`    | `airspy`, `airspy-r2`, `airspyr2`                                             |
| Best for           | High-quality VHF/UHF, wide single-band capture, weak-signal work              |

**Setup** — see [installation.txt §4](installation.txt) for the SoapySDR core and the AirSpy module. The Python venv **must** be created with `--system-site-packages` so it can access the system-installed SoapySDR Python bindings.

**Recommended starting config**
- `snr_threshold_db: 6` (the higher sensitivity makes the RTL default 4.5 dB too noisy)
- `sdr_gain_db: auto` to start; only move to per-element tuning if you need to optimise noise figure
- `activation_variance_db: 3.0`
- `sample_rate: 2.5e6` for narrow bands, `10e6` for wide ones

**Gotchas**
- **Sample rates are discrete.** Asking for anything other than 2.5 MHz or 10 MHz silently snaps to the nearest supported rate and logs a warning. Always check the startup log to confirm the rate the device actually accepted.
- For per-element tuning, **maximise LNA first**, set Mixer moderate, fine-tune with VGA (this is the LNA-first principle described in [Gain Tuning](#gain-tuning) below). The element names and ranges are logged at INFO level when the device starts up.
- Requires a venv built with `--system-site-packages`.

**Working example band** — PMR446 with per-element gain control:

```yaml
pmr_airspy:
    type: PMR
    freq_start: 446.00625e+6
    freq_end: 446.19375e+6
    sample_rate: 2.5e6
    sdr_gain_elements:
      LNA: 10
      MIX: 5
      VGA: 12
```

Run with:

```bash
substation --band pmr_airspy --device-type airspy --device-index 0
```

### AirSpy HF+ Discovery

A precision HF and lower-VHF receiver. Exceptional sensitivity and dynamic range in its bands; not a wideband scanner — its maximum bandwidth is 768 kHz. Best in class for HF listening, weak-signal work, and narrow-band airband / amateur scanning.

| Spec               | Value                                                                              |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frequency range    | 0.5 kHz - 31 MHz, 60 - 260 MHz (two separate bands, not contiguous)                |
| Max bandwidth      | 768 kHz                                                                            |
| Sample rates       | Discrete: typically 0.192, 0.228, 0.384, 0.456, 0.650, 0.768, 0.912 MHz (see log)  |
| ADC resolution     | 18-bit                                                                             |
| Gain architecture  | LNA on/off (0 or +6 dB) + RF *attenuator* (-48 to 0 dB)                            |
| AGC                | Hardware multi-loop AGC (recommended starting point)                               |
| Driver             | SoapySDR + `soapysdr-module-airspyhf` (system package)                             |
| `--device-type`    | `airspyhf`, `airspy-hf`, `airspyhf+`                                               |
| Best for           | HF and lower-VHF precision work, weak-signal listening, narrow-band scanning       |

**Setup** — see [installation.txt §4](installation.txt). On Raspberry Pi OS the `soapysdr-module-airspyhf` package may not be available in the distro repos; the install guide covers building it from source. As with the AirSpy R2, the venv **must** be created with `--system-site-packages`.

**Recommended starting config**
- `snr_threshold_db: 6` (essential — the device is sensitive enough that the RTL default 4.5 dB triggers on near-noise)
- `sdr_gain_db: auto` (engages the well-tuned hardware multi-loop AGC)
- `activation_variance_db: 3.0` (**also essential** — without it the high sensitivity surfaces stationary noise as false channel activations; see [Rejecting empty/noise recordings](#rejecting-emptynoise-recordings))
- `sample_rate: 0.912e6` for the widest capture

**Gotchas**
- **Sample rates are discrete.** The exact list depends on firmware — check the startup log for the rates your device actually reports. Asking for an unsupported rate silently snaps to the nearest and logs a warning.
- **The RF gain element is an *attenuator*, not an amplifier.** Negative dB. `RF: 0` means *no* attenuation (maximum signal); `RF: -24` means 24 dB of attenuation. This is the opposite of every other device here.
- The LNA is binary (0 or 6 dB) — there is no smooth manual control of the front end.
- **CF32 samples are delivered well below the [-1, 1] range** that the demodulator expects. The wrapper auto-calibrates this on startup by measuring the median RMS of warmup blocks and applying a normalisation scale; you'll see an `IQ calibration: ...` line in the startup log. No user action required.
- Front-end overload looks like duplicate signals on adjacent channels. If you see them, increase RF attenuation (`RF: -24` or lower).
- Requires a venv built with `--system-site-packages`.

**Working example band** — Bristol airband:

```yaml
air_civil_bristol_airspyhf:
    type: AIR
    freq_start: 125.5e+6
    freq_end: 126.0e+6
    sample_rate: 0.912e6
    snr_threshold_db: 6
    sdr_gain_db: auto
    activation_variance_db: 3.0
```

Run with:

```bash
substation --band air_civil_bristol_airspyhf --device-type airspyhf --device-index 0
```

### Other SoapySDR Devices

Any device with a SoapySDR driver module installed can be used via `--device-type soapy:<driver>` (for example, `soapy:lime` or `soapy:plutosdr`). To discover what's connected and what driver name to use, run:

```bash
SoapySDRUtil --find
```

The same `sdr_gain_db`, `sdr_gain_elements`, and `sdr_device_settings` config keys apply, and the wrapper's startup log will show the available gain elements, sample rates, antennas, and device-specific settings reported by the driver — use these to guide your configuration in the same way as the AirSpy cards above.

## Key Features & Optimizations
- **Advanced Signal Detection**: Uses Welch's Power Spectral Density (PSD) estimation for stable, low-variance activity detection. The noise floor is EMA-smoothed across slices to eliminate jitter, with a warmup period that absorbs SDR hardware startup transients before detection begins.
- **Statistical Noise Rejection**: A temporal variance check at channel turn-on distinguishes real signals (voice, data bursts — high variance) from stationary noise (low variance), eliminating the "empty hiss" recordings that plague high-sensitivity receivers. Works for any modulation type. See [Rejecting empty/noise recordings](#rejecting-emptynoise-recordings) below.
- **Parallel Multi-Channel Recording**: Simultaneously detects and records all active channels in a band - unlike traditional handheld scanners which only play one channel at a time.
- **High-Fidelity Demodulation**: Implements stateful AM and NFM demodulation with continuous phase tracking and DC-blocking, eliminating pops and discontinuities between audio blocks.
- **Precise Transition Trimming**: After coarse PSD-based detection, demodulated audio is scanned at sample level to find exact signal boundaries. Padding is added around the boundary and faded with a half-cosine S-curve, preserving signal content (including attack transients) while eliminating clicks.
- **Hardware Efficiency**:
    - **Vectorized Math**: Heavy processing is delegated to NumPy and SciPy for maximum throughput.
    - **Zero-Copy Architecture**: Uses memory stride tricks for overlapping FFT segments, avoiding expensive data copying.
    - **Lazy Evaluation**: Computationally expensive segment analysis is performed only when transitions are detected, drastically reducing idle CPU load.
    - **Pre-Allocated Ring Buffer**: Per-channel audio buffering uses a fixed NumPy array with modulo wrap-around, eliminating per-flush concatenation and GC pressure.
- **State-of-the-Art Processing**:
    - **Vectorized AGC**: High-quality, smooth automatic gain control for AM with independent attack and release timings.
    - **Noise-Floor-Guided Spectral Subtraction**: The band-wide PSD noise floor is passed to the spectral subtraction stage for more reliable noise frame classification, reducing musical noise artifacts compared to percentile-only heuristics.
    - **Float64 Filter State**: IIR filter states (channel extraction, decimation) use double precision to prevent rounding drift in long-running sessions.
- **Parallel Scanning**: Supports multiple SDR devices (RTL-SDR and HackRF) simultaneously with asynchronous I/O.
- **Archive Ready**: Automatic recording to Broadcast WAV (BWF) with embedded metadata (frequency, timestamps, modulation).

## Quick Start
1) Install dependencies (see `installation.txt` for SDR drivers).
2) Configure bands in `config.yaml`.
3) Install package in editable mode:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
4) Run:

```bash
substation --band air_civil_bristol --device-type rtlsdr --device-index 0
```

Audio files are written to:
```
./audio/YYYY-MM-DD/<band>/<timestamp>_<band>_<channel>_<snr>dB_<device>_<index>.wav
```

## Command Line
```bash
substation --band <band> [--config <path>] [--device-type rtlsdr|hackrf|airspy|airspyhf|soapy:<driver>] [--device-index N]
substation --list-bands
```

## Python Module Usage
You can also use the scanner as a library in your own code. This allows you to respond to radio events programmatically.

```python
import asyncio

import substation.config
import substation.scanner

# State Callback: Triggered whenever a signal starts or stops
def my_state_handler (band: str, ch: int, active: bool, snr: float) -> None:
	print (f"Channel {ch} is now {'ON' if active else 'OFF'} ({snr:.1f} dB)")

# Recording Callback: Triggered when a file is finalized and closed
def my_recording_handler (band: str, ch: int, file_path: str) -> None:
	print (f"Recording finished: {file_path}")

async def main () -> None:

	"""
	Initialize the scanner and respond to real-time events.
	"""

	# Load configuration
	config_data = substation.config.load_config ("config.yaml")

	# Initialize scanner instance
	scanner = substation.scanner.RadioScanner (
		config=config_data,
		band_name="pmr",
		device_type="rtlsdr"
	)

	# Register the handlers
	scanner.add_state_callback (my_state_handler)
	scanner.add_recording_callback (my_recording_handler)

	# Start the asynchronous scan loop
	await scanner.scan ()

if __name__ == "__main__":
	asyncio.run (main ())
```

See [examples/scan_demo.py](examples/scan_demo.py) for a more detailed implementation.

Options:
- `--config`, `-c`: path to config file (default `config.yaml`).
- `--band`, `-b`: band name to scan (required unless `--list-bands`).
- `--device-type`, `-t`: `rtlsdr`, `hackrf`, `airspy`, `airspyhf`, or `soapy:<driver>` (default `rtlsdr`).
- `--device-index`, `-i`: device index (default `0`).
- `--list-bands`: list available bands and exit.

## Configuration
Config file is YAML. The top-level keys are `scanner`, `recording`, `band_defaults`, and `bands`.

- `sdr_device_sample_size`: number of IQ samples per SDR callback. Higher values reduce callback overhead but increase latency.
- `band_time_slice_ms`: time slice used for PSD/SNR detection. Must be a multiple of `sdr_device_sample_size` (rounded up internally).
- `sample_queue_maxsize`: async queue depth. 10-50 is typical; higher tolerates bursts but uses more RAM.
- `calibration_frequency_hz`: optional known signal for PPM correction; set to `null` to disable.
- `stuck_channel_threshold_seconds`: optional duration in seconds after which a constant signal will trigger a "Stuck Channel" warning. Useful for identifying interference or stuck transmitters. Set to `null` to disable.

## SoapySDR Installation (AirSpy and other devices)

AirSpy devices (and any other `soapy:<driver>` device) require SoapySDR, which is installed at the system level:

```bash
# Raspberry Pi OS / Debian
sudo apt install -y soapysdr-tools python3-soapysdr
sudo apt install -y soapysdr-module-airspy      # AirSpy R2
sudo apt install -y soapysdr-module-airspyhf    # AirSpy HF+ Discovery

# If soapysdr-module-airspyhf is not in your distro's repos (e.g., Raspberry Pi OS),
# build from source instead:
sudo apt install -y libairspyhf-dev libsoapysdr-dev cmake
git clone https://github.com/pothosware/SoapyAirspyHF.git
cd SoapyAirspyHF && mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make && sudo make install && cd ../..

# Verify SoapySDR can see connected devices
SoapySDRUtil --find
```

The Python virtual environment **must** be created with `--system-site-packages` to access the system-installed SoapySDR bindings:

```bash
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages /home/si/venvs/substation
```

## Broadcast WAV (BWF) & Metadata
Each recording captures industry-standard **Broadcast WAV (BWF)** metadata (EBU Tech 3285). This embeds technical details directly into the audio file, making it ideal for archival and automated post-processing.

**Compatibility**: These are standard `.wav` files. They will play perfectly in any normal audio player (VLC, Windows Media Player, Audacity, mobile devices, etc.).

### Metadata Example
If you open a recording in a professional audio tool or a BWF viewer, you will see fields like these:

| Field | Example Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Description** | `{"band":"pmr","channel_index":0,"channel_freq":446006250.0}` | Machine-readable JSON with channel details |
| **Coding History** | `A=PCM,F=16000,W=16,M=mono,T=NFM;Frequency=446.00625MHz` | Technical signal chain (Algorithm, Rate, Modulation) |
| **Originator** | `Substation` | The software that created the file |
| **Origination Date** | `2026-01-27` | Date the recording started |
| **Time Reference** | `1152000` | Sample count since midnight (for precise timing) |


## Gain Tuning

Each device card above carries the gain settings that work as a starting point for that specific device. This section explains the *why* behind those settings — the principles that apply to any SDR with multiple gain stages, so you can reason about adjustments when the defaults aren't quite right.

SDR gain controls how much the received signal is amplified before digitisation. Too little gain and weak signals are lost in the noise floor; too much and strong signals overdrive the ADC, causing distortion and spurious detections.

**Simple approach (recommended starting point)**: set `sdr_gain_db` to a numeric value or `auto`. When set to a single number, the driver distributes the gain across the device's internal stages automatically — this produces good results for most setups without any per-element knowledge. Start here and only move to per-element tuning if you want to squeeze out the last bit of performance.

**Per-element tuning (advanced)**: devices with multiple gain stages (like the AirSpy R2) allow individual control via `sdr_gain_elements`. This can improve reception quality because the *order* of gain stages matters for noise performance:

| Stage | Role | Tuning guidance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LNA** (Low-Noise Amplifier) | First amplifier in the chain. Has the greatest impact on overall noise figure. | Set as high as possible without overloading from strong nearby signals. This is where sensitivity is won or lost. |
| **Mixer** | Frequency conversion stage. | Moderate gain. Too high increases intermodulation distortion (ghost signals from mixing products of strong stations). |
| **VGA** (Variable Gain Amplifier) | Final gain stage before the ADC. | Use to bring the overall signal level into the ADC's optimal range. Boosting here amplifies noise from earlier stages equally, so it contributes the least to sensitivity. |

The general principle is: **maximise gain early in the chain** (LNA) and **minimise gain late** (VGA), within the limits of what doesn't cause overload. This keeps the signal-to-noise ratio as high as possible through the receive chain.

**SNR threshold tuning**:

The `snr_threshold_db` setting controls how far above the noise floor a signal must be before it's detected. Each device card above lists a sensible starting value for that hardware. To adjust:

- If you're getting recordings that are mostly noise, raise the threshold by 1-2 dB at a time, *and* enable [`activation_variance_db`](#rejecting-emptynoise-recordings) if you haven't already — variance rejection catches the noise triggers that the SNR check can't distinguish.
- If you're missing transmissions you can hear on a handheld scanner, lower the threshold.
- The OFF threshold is always 3 dB below the ON threshold (hysteresis) to prevent rapid toggling.

**General tips**:
- Available gain element names and their valid ranges are logged at INFO level on startup. Check these before setting values.
- Optimal values depend on your antenna, band, and local RF environment — a rooftop antenna in a city needs different gain from a small whip in a rural area.
- Airband (AM, 118-137 MHz) typically needs less gain than PMR (NFM, 446 MHz) because aircraft transmitters are more powerful (5-25W) than PMR handhelds (0.5W).

## Rejecting empty/noise recordings

### The problem

SNR thresholds detect any signal that's louder than the noise floor — but they can't distinguish a *real* signal from a *noisy* one. With sensitive receivers like the AirSpy HF+ Discovery, you'll often see channels register 6-10 dB SNR yet contain only hissing static when played back. Raising `snr_threshold_db` doesn't help: the SNR is genuinely high, because the noise in that channel really is louder than the band-wide noise floor.

What's needed is a way to tell **stationary noise** apart from **real, time-varying signals**.

### The solution: temporal variance

Real signals fluctuate over time:

- **Voice** (AM airband, NFM PMR/marine): syllables, gaps, attack and release create 5-15 dB power swings within a 200 ms detection window
- **TDMA data** (TETRA, DMR): timeslot structure produces sharp on/off transitions
- **Burst data** (ACARS, VDL Mode 2): the entire transmission is a short burst, with quiet on either side
- **Beacons / morse**: dot/dash patterns create clear modulation

Stationary noise — atmospheric, thermal, or computer-generated interference — produces **near-constant power** across the same window. Its temporal standard deviation is close to the natural sampling variance of an ideal PSD estimate (1-2 dB), regardless of how high its average power crosses the SNR threshold.

The scanner measures the standard deviation of each channel's power across the 8 segment PSDs that make up the Welch detection window. At the moment a channel transitions from inactive to active, if that standard deviation falls below `activation_variance_db`, the activation itself is suppressed — the channel never enters the active state, so no detection event fires and no recording is created. The check applies to every band regardless of whether recording is enabled.

### Example

Imagine a "noisy" channel with average power 9 dB above the noise floor and a real voice transmission also at 9 dB SNR:

| Source | Avg SNR | Per-segment power (dB above floor) | Std dev |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Stationary noise | 9 dB | 9.1, 8.8, 9.0, 9.2, 8.9, 9.1, 8.7, 9.2 | **0.18 dB** |
| Voice transmission | 9 dB | 4.0, 12.5, 14.1, 7.0, 13.8, 11.2, 5.5, 3.9 | **4.3 dB** |

With `activation_variance_db: 3.0`, the noise is suppressed (0.18 < 3.0) and the voice is recorded (4.3 > 3.0). Both have the *same average SNR* — the variance check is what distinguishes them.

### Configuration

```yaml
bands:
  air_civil_bristol_airspyhf:
    type: AIR
    freq_start: 125.5e+6
    freq_end: 126.0e+6
    sample_rate: 0.912e6
    snr_threshold_db: 6
    activation_variance_db: 3.0  # Reject stationary-noise triggers
    sdr_gain_db: auto
```

The check runs **only at the moment a channel turns on**. Once a recording is in progress, brief gaps in the audio (silences between words) don't interrupt it — those are handled by the existing hold-time logic. Recordings end naturally when the SNR drops below the OFF threshold for longer than the hold time.

### How it interacts with other settings

| Setting | Relationship |
| :--- | :--- |
| `snr_threshold_db` | Runs first. Channels below the SNR threshold never get evaluated by the variance check. |
| `activation_variance_db` | Runs second, only on turn-on transitions, only when the SNR check passed. |
| Hysteresis (built-in 3 dB margin) | Unchanged. Once a recording starts, it continues until SNR drops below `snr_threshold_db - 3`. |
| Hold time (`recording_hold_time_ms`) | Unchanged. Brief drops in SNR during active recording are tolerated. |

The variance check is fundamentally a *gate*, not a *filter* — it decides whether to consider a channel active, then steps out of the way.

### Tuning guidance

| Symptom | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| Default works | Leave it alone — the default of `3.0 dB` is chosen to cleanly separate noise from any modulated signal |
| Real signals (voice, data) being rejected | Lower the threshold: try `2.0` or `2.5` |
| Noise still triggers recordings | Raise the threshold: try `4.0` or `5.0` |
| Want to disable entirely | Set to `0` |
| Want to compare with/without | Run two scanner instances on different bands, one with the field set, one with `activation_variance_db: 0` |

### How to confirm it's working

Suppression events are logged at **DEBUG** level (they're frequent enough that logging them at INFO would clutter normal output). Run the scanner with debug logging enabled to see them:

```bash
PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 substation --band air_civil_bristol_airspyhf --device-type airspyhf 2>&1 | grep suppressed
```

Or set the root log level to DEBUG by modifying the logging configuration. You'll then see lines like:

```
Channel 18 suppressed: power variance 0.4 dB below threshold 3.0 dB (likely noise)
```

This means the variance check rejected an activation that the SNR check would have accepted. Real signals don't produce this log line — they pass straight through to recording.

If you've enabled debug logging and see *no* suppression lines while still getting empty recordings, it means the noise has more variance than expected (e.g., bursty interference rather than constant hiss). Raise the threshold or investigate the interference source.

### Generality

The check operates on raw channel power computed from FFT bins, not on demodulated audio. This means it works identically for:

- AM airband voice
- NFM PMR, marine VHF, business radio, amateur 2m
- TDMA data (TETRA, DMR) — frame structure produces strong variance
- Burst data (ACARS, VDL Mode 2) — bursts produce maximum variance against silence
- Any future modulation type added to the scanner — no demodulator-specific tuning needed

## Parallel Scans (Multiple Devices)
Run one process per device:

```bash
substation --band air_civil_bristol --device-type rtlsdr --device-index 0
substation --band pmr --device-type rtlsdr --device-index 1
```

If you need stricter real-time behavior, you can pin each scan to a CPU core:

```bash
taskset -c 2 substation --band air_civil_bristol --device-index 0
taskset -c 3 substation --band pmr --device-index 1
```

## Resource and Performance Notes
- **Sample rate dominates CPU**. Large bands at high sample rates increase FFT/PSD load.
- **Overrun warnings** indicate the processing of a slice exceeded its real-time window. This can lead to dropped IQ blocks (`Sample queue full`).
- **Noise reduction** runs during write/flush if enabled (default). It uses `apply_spectral_subtraction` which is efficient and receives the band-wide noise floor for improved frame classification. The alternative `apply_noisereduce` implementation exists in `substation/dsp/noise_reduction.py` for reference but is not used by default as it is significantly more CPU-intensive.
- **Queue size** provides burst tolerance but uses RAM (each slice can be several MB).

If you see repeated `Sample queue full` warnings, reduce the band's `sample_rate`, exclude channels, or increase `sample_queue_maxsize`.

## Limitations
- Processing is slice-based; extremely wide bands or multiple high-rate scans can exceed real-time capacity on low-power CPUs.
- If you enable `apply_noisereduce` (requires code change), it is CPU-intensive for long chunks; on constrained devices, stick with the default `apply_spectral_subtraction` or reduce `disk_flush_interval_seconds`.
