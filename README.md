SDR Scanner
===========

Overview
--------
SDR Scanner is an automated tool for monitoring and recording radio signals using Software Defined Radio (SDR) hardware. By connecting a supported USB receiver (like an RTL-SDR or HackRF), you can scan wide ranges of the radio spectrum—such as Airband or Maritime frequencies—and automatically record transmissions as they occur. The software handles the technical signal processing in the background, allowing you to capture radio traffic across various frequencies without the need for manual tuning.

Hardware Requirements
---------------------
To use this software, a compatible Software Defined Radio (SDR) USB device is required. The code has been specifically tested and verified with the following hardware:

*   **[RTL-SDR Blog V4 and V3](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/)**: High-quality, low-cost receivers.
*   **[HackRF One](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/one/)**: A wideband transceiver capable of monitoring much larger frequency spans.

Key Features & Optimizations
----------------------------
- **Advanced Signal Detection**: Uses Welch's Power Spectral Density (PSD) estimation for stable, low-variance activity detection.
- **High-Fidelity Demodulation**: Implements stateful AM and NFM demodulation with continuous phase tracking and DC-blocking, eliminating pops and discontinuities between audio blocks.
- **Hardware Efficiency**:
    - **Vectorized Math**: Heavy processing is delegated to NumPy and SciPy for maximum throughput.
    - **Zero-Copy Architecture**: Uses memory stride tricks for overlapping FFT segments, avoiding expensive data copying.
    - **Lazy Evaluation**: Computationally expensive segment analysis is performed only when transitions are detected, drastically reducing idle CPU load.
- **State-of-the-Art Processing**:
    - **Vectorized AGC**: High-quality, smooth automatic gain control for AM with independent attack and release timings.
    - **Adaptive Noise Reduction**: Custom spectral subtraction provides significant hiss reduction with minimal overhead compared to standard libraries.
- **Parallel Scanning**: Supports multiple SDR devices (RTL-SDR and HackRF) simultaneously with asynchronous I/O.
- **Archive Ready**: Automatic recording to Broadcast WAV (BWF) with embedded metadata (frequency, timestamps, modulation).

Quick Start
-----------
1) Install dependencies (see `installation.txt` for SDR drivers).
2) Configure bands in `config.yaml`.
3) Install package in editable mode:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
4) Run:

```bash
sdr-scanner --band=air_civil_bristol --device-type=rtlsdr --device-index=0
```

Audio files are written to:
```
./audio/YYYY-MM-DD/<band>/<timestamp>_<band>_<channel>_<snr>dB_<device>_<index>.wav
```

Command Line
------------
```bash
sdr-scanner --band <band> [--config <path>] [--device-type rtlsdr|hackrf] [--device-index N]
sdr-scanner --list-bands
```

Options:
- `--config`, `-c`: path to config file (default `config.yaml`).
- `--band`, `-b`: band name to scan (required unless `--list-bands`).
- `--device-type`, `-t`: `rtlsdr` or `hackrf` (default `rtlsdr`).
- `--device-index`, `-i`: device index (default `0`).
- `--list-bands`: list available bands and exit.

Configuration
-------------
Config file is YAML. The top-level keys are `scanner`, `recording`, `band_defaults`, and `bands`.

Scanner
```
scanner:
  sdr_device_sample_size: 131072
  band_time_slice_ms: 200
  sample_queue_maxsize: 30
  calibration_frequency_hz: 93.7e+6
```
- `sdr_device_sample_size`: number of IQ samples per SDR callback. Higher values reduce callback overhead but increase latency.
- `band_time_slice_ms`: time slice used for PSD/SNR detection. Must be a multiple of `sdr_device_sample_size` (rounded up internally).
- `sample_queue_maxsize`: async queue depth. 10-50 is typical; higher tolerates bursts but uses more RAM.
- `calibration_frequency_hz`: optional known signal for PPM correction; set to `null` to disable.

Recording
```
recording:
  buffer_size_seconds: 30
  disk_flush_interval_seconds: 5
  audio_sample_rate: 16000
  audio_output_dir: "./audio"
  fade_in_ms: 3
  fade_out_ms: 5
  soft_limit_drive: 2.0
```
- `buffer_size_seconds`: max in-memory audio per channel before drops.
- `disk_flush_interval_seconds`: how often to flush to disk.
- `audio_sample_rate`: output WAV rate (Hz).
- `fade_in_ms`/`fade_out_ms`: fades applied at channel start/stop.
- `soft_limit_drive`: post-processing soft limiter drive. Typical range 1.5-3.0 (higher = stronger limiting).
- `noise_reduction_enabled`: toggle spectral subtraction noise reduction (default: true).
- `recording_hold_time_ms`: duration in ms to continue recording after signal drops below threshold (default: 500).

Band Defaults
```
band_defaults:
  AIR:
    channel_spacing: 8.333e+3
    modulation: AM
    snr_threshold_db: 4.5
    sdr_gain_db: 30
```
These settings are merged into each band of the same `type`.

Bands
```
bands:
  air_civil_bristol:
    type: AIR
    freq_start: 125.5e+6
    freq_end: 126.0e+6
    sample_rate: 1.0e+6
    exclude_channel_indices: [33, 34]
```
Per-band keys:
- `freq_start` / `freq_end`: Hz.
- `channel_spacing`: Hz.
- `sample_rate`: Hz. Must cover the band plus margins; higher rates increase CPU.
- `channel_width`: optional; defaults to `channel_spacing * 0.84`.
- `type`: used to inherit defaults from `band_defaults`.
- `modulation`: `AM` or `NFM`.
- `recording_enabled`: enable recording for this band. Optional, defaults to `false` (can also be set in `band_defaults`).
- `snr_threshold_db`: detection threshold (dB above noise floor).
- `sdr_gain_db`: numeric or `auto`.
- `exclude_channel_indices`: 0-based indices to skip (no analysis, no recording).

Broadcast WAV (BWF) & Metadata
------------------------------
Each recording captures industry-standard **Broadcast WAV (BWF)** metadata (EBU Tech 3285). This embeds technical details directly into the audio file, making it ideal for archival and automated post-processing.

**Compatibility**: These are standard `.wav` files. They will play perfectly in any normal audio player (VLC, Windows Media Player, Audacity, mobile devices, etc.).

### Metadata Example
If you open a recording in a professional audio tool or a BWF viewer, you will see fields like these:

| Field | Example Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Description** | `{"band":"pmr","channel_index":0,"channel_freq":446006250.0}` | Machine-readable JSON with channel details |
| **Coding History** | `A=PCM,F=16000,W=16,M=mono,T=NFM;Frequency=446.00625MHz` | Technical signal chain (Algorithm, Rate, Modulation) |
| **Originator** | `SDR Scanner` | The software that created the file |
| **Origination Date** | `2026-01-27` | Date the recording started |
| **Time Reference** | `1152000` | Sample count since midnight (for precise timing) |


Parallel Scans (Multiple Devices)
---------------------------------
Run one process per device:

```bash
sdr-scanner --band=air_civil_bristol --device-type=rtlsdr --device-index=0
sdr-scanner --band=pmr --device-type=rtlsdr --device-index=1
```

If you need stricter real-time behavior, you can pin each scan to a CPU core:

```bash
taskset -c 2 sdr-scanner --band=air_civil_bristol --device-index=0
taskset -c 3 sdr-scanner --band=pmr --device-index=1
```

Resource and Performance Notes
------------------------------
- **Sample rate dominates CPU**. Large bands at high sample rates increase FFT/PSD load.
- **Overrun warnings** indicate the processing of a slice exceeded its real-time window. This can lead to dropped IQ blocks (`Sample queue full`).
- **Noise reduction** runs during write/flush if enabled (default). It uses `apply_spectral_subtraction` which is efficient. The alternative `apply_noisereduce` implementation exists in `sdr_scanner/dsp/noise_reduction.py` for reference but is not used by default as it is significantly more CPU-intensive.
- **Queue size** provides burst tolerance but uses RAM (each slice can be several MB).

If you see repeated `Sample queue full` warnings, reduce the band's `sample_rate`, exclude channels, or increase `sample_queue_maxsize`.

Limitations
-----------
- Processing is slice-based; extremely wide bands or multiple high-rate scans can exceed real-time capacity on low-power CPUs.
- If you enable `apply_noisereduce` (requires code change), it is CPU-intensive for long chunks; on constrained devices, stick with the default `apply_spectral_subtraction` or reduce `disk_flush_interval_seconds`.
