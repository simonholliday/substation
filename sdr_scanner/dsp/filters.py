"""
Audio processing and filtering functions.

Provides sample rate conversion (decimation and resampling), audio fades,
and other signal conditioning needed for clean audio output from demodulated RF.

Key functions:
- decimate_audio: Convert from RF sample rate to audio sample rate with anti-aliasing
- apply_fade: Apply smooth fade-in/fade-out to prevent clicks at recording boundaries

	"""
	Decimate signal from sample_rate to audio_sample_rate with state preservation.

	Decimation reduces the sample rate by an integer factor (e.g., 2 MHz -> 48 kHz).
	This requires anti-aliasing filtering before downsampling to prevent aliasing
	(high frequencies folding back into the audible range).

	When the ratio is not an integer, uses rational resampling (upsample then downsample)
	which is more expensive but handles arbitrary rate conversions.

	Args:
		signal: Input signal to decimate
		sample_rate: Input sample rate in Hz
		audio_sample_rate: Target sample rate in Hz
		state: State dict for filter continuity

	Returns:
