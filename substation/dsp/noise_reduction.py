"""
Noise reduction algorithms for improving audio quality.

Provides three noise reduction approaches:
1. apply_noisereduce: Uses the noisereduce library (spectral subtraction with noise profile)
2. apply_spectral_subtraction: Custom spectral subtraction implementation
3. apply_dynamics_curve: Per-sample dual-region expander (downward + upward)

The first two methods estimate the noise floor from quiet portions of the audio,
then subtract the noise spectrum from the signal spectrum. This reduces
background hiss and static while preserving speech/signals.

apply_dynamics_curve is a memoryless waveshaper that operates in dBFS:
quiet samples below a threshold are softly cut towards a silence floor
(downward expansion), and loud samples above the threshold are gently
boosted (upward expansion).  Both regions widen the dynamic range, so the
function as a whole is a dual-region expander.

Note: Aggressive noise reduction can introduce "musical noise" artifacts
(random burbling sounds). The spectral algorithms use smoothing to
minimize this.  apply_dynamics_curve is sample-level and can introduce
mild harmonic distortion on signals near the threshold; the curves are
shaped to keep this benign at sensible parameter values.

	"""
	Apply a dual-region expander transfer curve to an audio signal.

	This is a memoryless, sample-level waveshaper that maps each input
	sample's dBFS level to an output dBFS level via two smooth curves
	joined at ``threshold_dbfs``:

	- **Below the threshold (cut region — downward expansion).**  Samples
	  whose magnitude falls between ``floor_dbfs`` and ``threshold_dbfs``
	  are progressively reduced.  The reduction follows a smoothstep
	  S-curve in dB space, reaching exactly ``cut_db`` at the curve's
	  midpoint and ``2 * cut_db`` at the floor.  The curve has zero slope
	  at both endpoints, so there is no audible kink at the threshold or
	  the floor.  Below ``floor_dbfs`` the output is hard-zeroed (true
	  digital silence).

	- **Above the threshold (boost region — upward expansion).**  Samples
	  whose magnitude falls between ``threshold_dbfs`` and 0 dBFS are
	  gently boosted by up to ``boost_db`` at the curve's midpoint, with
	  zero boost at both ends.  The shape is ``sin²(π·t)`` so the curve
	  is tangent to unity at both the threshold and full scale, and there
	  is no clipping introduced *for any sensible configuration* (see the
	  defensive clamp below).

	The two regions together widen the overall dynamic range — quiet
	noise gets quieter, loud voice gets louder — making this useful as a
	noise-reduction polish step on top of spectral subtraction.

	The function is memoryless: it has no envelope follower, no attack
	or release, and no inter-block state.  Because the gain is computed
	from each sample's instantaneous magnitude, signals that cross the
	threshold within a waveform cycle pick up a small amount of harmonic
	distortion.  At the default ``cut_db`` and ``boost_db`` values this
	is benign; aggressive settings will produce a perceptible "edge" on
	the loudest syllables.

	**Defensive clamp.**  After the curves are applied the output is
	clamped to ``[-1, 1]`` as belt-and-braces protection against any
	configuration that would otherwise drive the boost region above 0
	dBFS.  With sensible defaults this clamp never engages, but it
	prevents speaker damage if the user picks adventurous parameter
	combinations.

	Args:
		samples: Input audio samples, float, normalised to [-1, 1].
		threshold_dbfs: Dividing line between the cut and boost regions.
			Samples at exactly this level pass through unchanged.
			Typical values: -20 to -35 dBFS for ATC airband audio.
		cut_db: Gain reduction at the midpoint of the cut S-curve.  The
			maximum reduction (at the floor) is twice this value.  Set to
			0.0 to disable the cut region entirely.
		boost_db: Maximum gain boost at the peak of the boost hump.  Set
			to 0.0 to disable the boost region entirely.
		floor_dbfs: Lower threshold.  Samples whose magnitude is at or
			below this level are output as exactly 0.0.
		cut_curve: Position of the steepest gradient within the cut
			S-curve, in (0, 1).  0.5 = symmetric (steepest at the
			midpoint).  Lower values shift the steepest part toward the
			threshold; higher values shift it toward the floor.
		boost_curve: Same concept for the boost hump.  0.5 = symmetric.
			Lower values shift the peak toward the threshold; higher
			values shift it toward 0 dBFS.

		A new numpy array of the same shape and dtype as the input,
		containing the processed samples.
