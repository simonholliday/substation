def _pick_if_decimation (sample_rate: float, audio_sample_rate: int, oversample: float) -> int:

	"""
	Choose an integer decimation factor for the IF stage that produces a
	clean intermediate rate.

	The naive choice — round(sample_rate / target_if_rate) — is correct
	when sample_rate is an integer multiple of audio_sample_rate but
	produces pathological resampling otherwise.  For example, with
	sample_rate=2500000 and audio_sample_rate=16000, the naive answer is
	39, which yields if_rate=64103 — coprime with 2500000, so the
	downstream rational resampler tries to allocate a 50-million-tap
	filter (~400 MB) and locks the system up.

	This helper picks a decimation factor with two preferences, in order:

	1. **"Clean chain" divisors first.**  A divisor d such that *both*
	   `sample_rate % d == 0` AND `(sample_rate // d) % audio_sample_rate == 0`
	   means the downstream decimate_audio call will also take its integer
	   (sosfilt-based) path.  That matters because the rational resample
	   path in filters._decimate_common is not genuinely stateful — it
	   emits a short tail transient at every block boundary, producing
	   an audible ~5 Hz click in recordings at the slice rate.  Picking
	   a clean-chain divisor avoids the rational path entirely.

	2. **Any integer divisor of sample_rate.**  Falls back when no clean
	   chain exists (e.g. AirSpy R2 at 2.5 MHz → 16 kHz: 2500000 = 2^5·5^7
	   and 16000 = 2^7·5^3 have incompatible power-of-two factors, so no
	   integer divisor of 2500000 is also a multiple of 16000).  The
	   rational-resample path still kicks in here; it's the lesser evil
	   versus the pathological filter size that the naive code would
	   otherwise produce.

	Within whichever tier applies, the candidate closest to the ideal
	is chosen (ties broken by preferring the larger decimation = lower
	IF rate = less downstream CPU).  If no integer divisor exists in
	the search window at all, the rounded ideal is returned as a last
	resort and the defensive backstop in _decimate_common will catch
	the pathological cases.

	Args:
		sample_rate: SDR sample rate in Hz
		audio_sample_rate: Final audio rate in Hz
		oversample: How many times the audio rate the IF should sit at
			(typically 4 for NFM to give the FM discriminator headroom).
			Dropping from 4x to 3x is fine when it's the price of
			landing in the clean-chain tier.

	Returns:
		An integer decimation factor.  Guaranteed >= 1.

	Demodulate Single Sideband (SSB) from IQ samples with state preservation.

	SSB transmissions occupy roughly 300 - 2700 Hz of audio bandwidth on
	one side of the carrier (USB = upper sideband, LSB = lower).  The
	channel-extracted IQ baseband from scanner.py is centered on the
	conventional SSB carrier frequency (a virtual point — there is no
	actual carrier in the transmission), so the wanted sideband sits in
	the positive frequencies of the IQ for USB and the negative
	frequencies for LSB.

	# ----- Algorithm choice ----------------------------------------------
	#
	# Three approaches were considered:
	#
	#   1. Frequency-shift + low-pass + take real part.  Simple but
	#      requires aggressive filtering to suppress the unwanted sideband
	#      sitting just on the other side of DC, and weak signals develop
	#      a "warbling" quality from filter ripple.
	#
	#   2. Hilbert / phasing method via scipy.signal.hilbert.  Clean
	#      mathematically (the IQ stream from a quadrature SDR is already
	#      analytic, in principle), but the FFT-based Hilbert transform
	#      has poor block-boundary continuity unless overlap-save is
	#      added, and that's a non-trivial amount of state to manage.
	#
	#   3. Weaver's method: complex frequency shift to centre the wanted
	#      sideband on DC, real-valued low-pass on each of I and Q, then
	#      shift back and take the real part.  This is the standard
	#      receiver implementation in commercial SDR software (Gqrx,
	#      SDR#, fldigi all use it or a close variant).  It composes
	#      cleanly with scipy's stateful sosfilt() so block-boundary
	#      continuity is automatic, the LPF cleanly rejects the unwanted
	#      sideband (which sits two bandwidths away from DC after the
	#      shift), and there are no FFTs in the audio path.
	#
	# We use Weaver's method.  The two oscillators are stateful (phase
	# carries across blocks) and the LPF uses scipy's standard sosfilt
	# state vectors, identical to the pattern used by demodulate_nfm and
	# demodulate_am.

# Dictionary of available demodulators.
# USB and LSB share demodulate_ssb via functools.partial — they're the
# same algorithm with different sideband flags, but exposed as separate
# top-level modulation types because that's how every other SDR program
# (Gqrx, SDR#, SDRConsole, fldigi, WSJT-X) labels them.  Users specifying
# a band as `modulation: USB` or `modulation: LSB` get the natural label
# without needing a separate sideband config field.
