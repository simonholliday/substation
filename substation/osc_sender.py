"""
OSC event forwarding for Substation.

Bridges RadioScanner's existing channel-state and recording callbacks
onto OSC (Open Sound Control) messages, so downstream tools can react
to radio activity in real time.  Two OSC endpoints are supported:

- **Sequencer** (always): receives `/radio/state` and `/radio/recording`.
  Defaults to 127.0.0.1:9000, matching the Subsequence generative MIDI
  sequencer's OSC server.
- **Sampler** (optional): if `sampler_host` is provided, also receives
  `/sample/import` whenever a recording is finalised, so a sample-based
  instrument (e.g. Subsample on 127.0.0.1:9002) can load the new WAV
  without having to watch the output directory.

This module is **not** imported by any other part of Substation.  It
relies on python-osc, which is only installed when the `osc` optional
extra is present — keep the import here at module level so the
ImportError is immediate and obvious if a user forgets to install it.
Run `pip install -e ".[osc]"` to enable OSC support.

OSC address / argument reference (the Substation outbound addresses):

    /radio/state      band_name:str  channel_index:int  is_active:int(0/1)  snr_db:float  ctcss_hz:float  dcs_code:int
    /radio/recording  band_name:str  channel_index:int  file_path:str  ctcss_hz:float  dcs_code:int
    /sample/import    file_path:str                  (only when sampler_host is set)

ctcss_hz / dcs_code carry any subaudible tone detected on the activation.
OSC has no native null, so 0.0 / 0 mean "no tone detected" (valid CTCSS
tones start at 67 Hz and DCS codes are always nonzero).
