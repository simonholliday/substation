"""
Channel recording management with WAV and FLAC output support.

Handles buffered audio recording to WAV or FLAC files. WAV files include
industry-standard Broadcast WAV (BWF/BEXT) metadata with sample-accurate
timestamps for timeline placement in audio editors. FLAC files are lossless
compressed (~39% smaller) with Vorbis comment metadata (date and frequency
as text tags, but no timeline positioning support).

The recorder uses a memory buffer to avoid blocking the main processing
thread, and flushes to disk periodically in the background.

	"""Remove a carrier key-ON transient from the start of the audio.

	Carrier transient shape (what we're looking for):
	  - Very fast attack: the transmitter key-on produces a near-
	    instantaneous amplitude spike (sub-millisecond rise time).
	  - Brief duration: the entire transient (attack + decay) is
	    typically 1-10ms, always under 15ms.
	  - Exponential decay: amplitude drops back toward the noise floor
	    over a few milliseconds after the initial spike.
	  - Bordered by silence: the spike is preceded by noise-floor-level
	    audio (or nothing, if at sample zero) and followed by a quiet
	    gap before voice begins.

	This shape distinguishes carrier transients from voice plosives
	(e.g. 'p', 't'), which have a slower attack, are followed immediately
	by voiced content, and are preceded by other speech — not silence.

	Detection strategy:
	  1. Scan the first 500ms (wide window because the scanner may
	     detect the RF carrier hundreds of ms before the key-ON click).
	  2. Find the *earliest* spike that exceeds the detection threshold
	     (not the loudest — voice later in the window is often louder).
	  3. Verify the spike meets all three criteria:
	     - Pre-silence: region before spike is at noise floor (ratio > 8x)
	     - Duration: spike decays within 15ms
	     - Post-silence: 20ms after spike is quiet (< 25% of spike peak)
